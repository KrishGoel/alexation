An affordable Alexa home automation solution with NodeMCU using [Sinric.com](https://sinric.com).

## Steps
Huge shoutout to [@Mayoogh_Girish](https://www.instructables.com/member/Mayoogh_Girish/) for [his Instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/Amazon-Alexa-Smart-Home-Using-Node-MCU/).
This is the Instructable that I followed but to put it into perspective
- Sinric is a web service that enables the communication between NodeMCU and Alexa by acting as the middleware
- While you wouldn't require many external libraries, make sure you change the WiFi SSID and the password while compiling and uploading the code. Everything is beautifully explained in the attached Instructable.
- In the circuit schema, the battery represents any power input. Shoutout to [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/) for helping me make circuit schemas with ease.

Please feel free to contact me in  case of any queries :)
